BEFORE --> 


[Page refresh at /about]

Redux: user = null
↓
RouteProtection runs
→ sees user=null → redirects to /login
↓
AuthChecker fetches /user/profile (too late!)
→ sets user in Redux
(but you're already on /)


AFTER ---> 

[Page refresh at /about]

Redux: user=null, loading=true
↓
RouteProtection runs
→ sees loading=true → shows <Loading...> (no redirect yet)
↓
AuthChecker fetches /user/profile
   • if success → set user + loading=false
   • if fail → set user=null + loading=false
↓
RouteProtection runs again
   • if user exists → stay on /about
   • else → redirect to /login
